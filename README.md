# C1TerminalCorrelation2021Public
This is a public repo that summarizes our accomplishments in the Terminal Correlation One 2021 Europe Regional Phase, which widely regarded as the most prestigious and competitive hackathon competition in Europe.

Our code and approaches are contained in a private repo, as per the requirements of C1 so as not to divulge approaches that could potentially bring an unfair advantage to upcoming teams in future competitions.
